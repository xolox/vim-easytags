**Note to GitHub users:** This git repository doesn't include all of the auto-load scripts required by the plug-in. The easiest way to get the plug-in including its dependencies is to download [the latest ZIP archive](http://peterodding.com/code/vim/downloads/easytags).

If you're using [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) and want to keep the plug-in up to date using git, you can use the [easytags.vim mirror repository](https://github.com/vim-scripts/easytags.vim) by [vim-scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org/) which is synchronized with the latest release on [Vim Online](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3114) multiple times a day.
